I've posted this design while ago at my IG account and it's the perfect time to say some more about it. The star of this design is a fantastic stamping plate I've received couple of months ago. I have always been a great fan of steampunk themed designs. When I saw BPX L023 at the store the hungry monster deep inside has been awaken. The need to try new interesting nail  art products was still alive somewhere there. And when Alice from Born Pretty Store offered me to give it a try I just couldn't resist. The plate has full pack of bold steampunk patterns  with crisp lines and magnificient details. To transfer the image on the nails was easy even for a newbie as myself. I would definitely keep working over my stamping skill because plates like this really deserve to be used more often..."

Without you, we would not be here today.We attempted to visit Matterhorn today, but unfortunately the weather did not cooperate, and although we reached the village at the base of the mountain, the mountain itself was completely obscured by a snowstorm.Here are a few images from the last couple of days of our time in Switzerland. So far we have visited 4 chocolatiers, hiked around a lake at a ski resort which received 30 fresh centimeters of snow the day before we arrived, visited Liechtenstein, had an amazing traditional Swiss fondue, driven almost 1000kms across an amazing country, travelled via motorail (train ferry), gondola, car, and train, and spoken 3 languages.Tomorrow we are going to geek out and visit the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, and we still have a week left in our vacation!"
